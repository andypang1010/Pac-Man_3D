# Pac-Man_3D
A 3D remake of the classic Pac-Man game. The game features the classic Pac-Man on his quest trying to eat as many gems as possible without being caught by ghosts that are controlled by Unity NavMesh Agents. This game also changes the classic controls in the original Pac-Man game where you could only control the rotation of Pac-Man and now allows you to control the movement of the character too.

The ghosts are still to be implemented in the game but the environment and basic gameplay is complete.
